# How to build your own execution environment
1. I'm using the Red Hat Universal Base Image for RHEL 10.1 to build the execution environment, that means you also need access to that.
You can get access for free, [following these instructions](https://catalog.redhat.com/en/software/base-images).

2. Get ansible-builder. I used the upstream version of ansible-builder for Fedora 43, which is my own build rig.
```
$ pip install ansible-builder
```

3. Clone this repository
```
$ git clone https://github.com/mglantz/pqc-ee
```

4.
